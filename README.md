We make a system that will help us to automate and track our work. We are an NGO that works to feed deprived people and children. We have observed that people waste a ton of food daily in Dhaka city (like office programs, buffets, etc). We are on a mission to make the usage of these foods. We have contacted some restaurants, and they agreed to give us those foods before it gets rotten, or they will preserve those foods till we collect them from them. We have some employees and still enrolling. Workflow, 
1.	restaurants will open a collect request from their dashboard with the maximum time they can preserve.
2.	We will accept the collection request and assign an employee to manage the food.
3.	After collection the foods will be distributed by our employees and upon completion the collection request will be completed.
4.	System also needs to track all collect requests and their details.
